## Inspiration
- Climate change is one of the most pressing global issues today. We wanted to build a platform that allows individuals to stay informed on climate news and take actionable steps in combating climate change. The idea is to connect the power of AI with easy user engagement, promoting environmental awareness.
## What it does
- Cli-Change AI aggregates climate-related headlines, and users can interact by liking, and subscribing to newsletters, powered by Groq. The platform provides curated, AI-driven insights into the latest developments in climate science, policy, and activism, helping people stay informed and empowered.
## How we built it
- We built the platform using Django for the backend. We also implemented a daily email system, where subscribers receive curated climate news updates directly to their inbox. They can also see news for the last week and trending news within the last 24 hours and have these summarized by the AI model automatically.
## Challenges we ran into
- The API was very limited and we could only show 3 articles per day on the free plan. It was also difficult to test the daily email service and we over-spent time on this.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We're proud of developing a platform that not only keeps people informed but actively encourages engagement in climate-related topics. We hope people can stay up to date with the latest in climate change around the world while respecting their busy schedules.
## What we learned
- We learned a lot about managing complex relational databases in Django, handling user interaction features, and ensuring a scalable architecture. We also deepened our knowledge of how AI models can be applied in practical, real-world scenarios to drive user engagement.
## What's next for Cli-Change AI
- Next, we aim to expand the AI capabilities to provide even more personalized and impactful content. We also plan to introduce more interactive features like real-time discussions and challenges where users can contribute ideas on climate solutions. Additionally, were currently looking into how to deploy this and bypass the API rate limit.
